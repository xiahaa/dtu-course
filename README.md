# satellite-based-positioning

This repo contains assignments for the course Satellite based Positioning taken at DTU 2018.

# A, B, C
## Aims:
1. Coordinate transformation from ECEF, WGS84, Local ENU.
2. Prediction of satellites' position using the Kepler equations and parameters.
## Done:
1. Matlab GUI that can do transformation automatically;
2. Gif demonstrates satellite's orbits![demo](ex2/satellite.gif);
3. Matlab GUI that can read sp3 file and show visibility.

# D,E
## Aims:
1. interpolation of satellites positions using precise satellite positions from the sp3 file;
2. add ionospheric delay;
3. add tropospheric delay;
4. add satellite clock error;
5. add clock clock error;
6. GUI for simualtion;
