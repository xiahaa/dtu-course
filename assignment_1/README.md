## README
This is the implementation of the first exercise. Since I am using relative path to find some relevent functional files, do not make any changes to the folder extracted. 

### Two options
In the main entry called script.m, you will find two parameters to run this code:
1. skip = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]: means which question you would like to skip, e.g [1 2 3] means skip the first, second, and third questions, so only the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh questions will be executed.
2. drawGif = 1: if you want to generate GIF file, turn this to 1, otherwise 0.
