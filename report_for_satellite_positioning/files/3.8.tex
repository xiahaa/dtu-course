\section{Equations}
Equations should be indented by 0.75 cm. Equations are numbered on the right side with a number enclosed in brackets. The formula number shall consist of a chapter num-ber and serial number separated by a period. This is handled by using the Insert button in the Equation toolbar. 

You can make cross-references to equations using this button in the tool bar. This is, for example, a cross-reference to equation (3.1). 

The following are examples of equations:

\begin{align}
Y=\sum_{i}\frac{4k_i}{X_i} \\
Y=\sum_{i}\frac{4k_i}{X_i}
\end{align}
