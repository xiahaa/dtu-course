\chapter{Abstract}
%This report will present the procedures, results accomplished for assignments D-E which mainly includes the interpolation of satellite's position using precise ephemeris data and the computation of pseudo ranges by considering the delay of ionosphere, troposphere, the error caused by satellites' clock error as well as the clock error of the receiver.
This report will present the theory and results accomplished for the assignment F which mainly includes the computation of receiver's position from a set of pseudoranges using the Gauss-Newton method, the estimation of the corresponding dilution of precision (DOP) values.


Besides those normal requests, some relevant contents are also included 
as a personal interests, which includes several initialization 
methods (the Bancroft method, the direct linear transformation method, 
the second order cone programming method), the Fisher Information Matrix 
(FIM), the Cram\`erRao bound and their connections with the DOP matrix, 
several GDOP fast computation methods as well as using the augmented state vector for positio estimation.

% the relationship between the geometric distribution of satellites and the optimal GDOP, 
% fast optimal subset (subset of satellites with the minimum GDOP) selection method.
