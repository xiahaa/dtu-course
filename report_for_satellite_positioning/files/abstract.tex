\chapter{Abstract}
This report will present the procedures, results accomplished for assignments D-E which mainly includes the interpolation of satellite's position using precise ephemeris data and the computation of pseudo ranges by considering the delay of ionosphere, troposphere, the error caused by satellites' clock error as well as the clock error of the receiver.
