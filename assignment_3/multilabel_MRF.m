function [S,iter] = multilabel_MRF(U,dim,beta,max_iter)
%MULTILABEL_MRF Iterative alpha expansion.
% [S,iter] = MULTILABLE_MRF(U,dim,beta,max_iter) finds a solution for the
% Potts model, with the 2-clique potentials in {0,beta}, and the 1-clique 
% potentials for each vertex and label given in input U.
% 
% U is a N-times-K matrix with energy of each pixel/voxel for each label,
%   where N is a total number of pixels/voxels and K is a number of labels. 
% dim is a vector indicating the dimensions (size) of problem. It must be
%   such that prod(dim)=N.
% beta is a scalar weight of the neighorhood edges (2-clique potental for
%   different labels).
% max_iter is a maximum number of alpha expansion cycles (a cycle includes
%   K alpha expansion steps), defaults to 10.
% S is a length N vector of segmentation labels form {1,...,K}. S is of
%   type uint8, so up til 255 labels are suported.
% iter is a number of actually performed cycles.
%
% Using Kolmorogov+Zabih PAMI 2004 formulation (with directed edges) of
% alpha expansion from Boykov et al. PAMI 2001 (with auxiliary vertices), 
% but with source being not-alpha and sink as alpha (opposite to Boykov 
% formulation).
